# Prediction of News Reliability

Analysis of the Labelled Unreliable News (LUN) dataset and its usefulness in training language models for fake news detection.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure that you have Python >= `3.10.4` installed.
   If you are using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage your Python installations, Python `3.10.4` has already been specified in the project root.
1. Install the relevant dependencies.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. Download `raw_data.zip` [here](https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/CompareNet_FakeNewsDetection/releases/tag/dataset).
1. Extract the files into `raw_data`.

## Running the Models

The Naive Bayes, simple Neural Network, and Long Short Term Memory models can be found within the `models` directory as Jupyter notebooks.
